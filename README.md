#### Fisher's Iris Data Set

What it's about:

*Ronald Fisher* a renowned biologist and statistician used *The Iris Dataset* in his 1936 paper *The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems*. It is a multivariate dataset and Fisher used it in the development of his linear discriminate model which distinguishes the species from each other.

How it was collected:

The dataset examines three species of Iris: Iris Setosa, Iris Virginica and Irish Versicolor. The dataset is a compilations of 150 records, there is 50 samples of each species were which were used to measure specific features including the length and width of the sepals and petals.

## Python Code to Investigate The Iris Dataset

The Iris Dataset is available to view by running the file named 'iris_dataset.py'. All the columns and rows within the dataset with numerical values in cms are visible.
